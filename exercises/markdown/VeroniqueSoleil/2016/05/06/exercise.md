*    Some sentenses I love:
   
    > This is what happens, of course: men get lost, men vanish, men are erased and reborn.
    
    > What begins at the water shall end there, and what ends there shall once more begin.
*    The preview of some `secrets`:
     
    - Some questions left:
    
      + Who's the author VMS and who's the translator FXC?
      + What's the reader's role in this book?
      + Why the book is named as **The Ship of Theseus**?
      + What are the use of the goods left in this book?
    
      And, what I've left here are not all of the questions.
